# **Real-Time Data Visualization Dashboard**

## **Overview**  
This project is a take-home assignment where you will build a real-time web-based application that visualizes streaming data. The application will consist of:

- **A backend server** that receives floating-point data from a TCP stream at **100 samples/sec** (each sample has 10 values, one per channel).
- **A frontend client** that renders this data live on a line chart, displaying the last 30 seconds of data.

Your task is to design and implement a working solution, making decisions around data handling, communication between the client and server, and frontend state management.

*We do not ask you to invest more than **4 hours** in this project. Focus on delivering value, and clearly label the code where you would have done things differently if you had a week to complete the task.*

It's OK to use AI - see [below](#generative-ai).

### **If you have extra time (Optional Enhancements)**  
If time permits, add a **second chart** that displays a **moving average over the past 1 second (100 samples)** for each channel.

---

## **Requirements**  

### Backend
- The backend should receive the incoming data stream.
- It should provide a way for the frontend to access this real-time data efficiently.
- The backend can be implemented in the language you know best. At brain.space we use Python (w/FastAPI), but you can implement with any technology.

### Frontend
- The frontend should display 10 real-time lines on a single chart, with:  
  - **X-axis:** Time  
  - **Y-axis:** Value (one line per channel, 0-9)  
- The chart should update continuously as new data arrives, showing only the **last 30 seconds** of data.
- The frontend should retrieve and manage data from the backend in a performant way.
- The dashboard should ideally be implemented with **React**.

### **Extra Credit (Optional)**  
- Add a **second chart** that displays a **1-second moving average** for each channel.
- Decide where and how to compute the moving average while keeping performance optimal.
- Add any other cool features you think might be nice, either fully implementing them or adding a placeholder and comments.

## **Setup Instructions**  

### For and Clone the Repository**  
Fork this repository and clone it to your local machine:
```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/takehome-fullstack-fe.git
$ cd takehome-fullstack-fe
```

### Run the mock data generator
```sh
node datagen.js
```

You can test the datagen server by running:
```sh
telnet localhost 9000
```

---

## **Deliverables**  
1. Access to forked repository, containing a `README.md` with updated instructions.
1. A **short design document** (can be a markdown file in the repo) covering:
   - Architecture choices (data handling, communication, rendering strategy).
   - Challenges faced and trade-offs made due to time constraints.
   - What you'd improve or do differently with more time.
---

## **Discussion Topics for the Interview**  
After completing the assignment, weâ€™ll discuss:
- **Backend Design:** How did you handle the data stream? How does the backend communicate with the frontend?
- **Frontend Architecture:** How does the frontend manage state and performance while rendering real-time data?
- **Performance Optimizations:** How does the system scale with a higher sampling rate or more channels?
- **Trade-offs & Improvements:** What challenges did you face, and how would you improve the system?

---

## **Next Steps**  
1. Clone the provided repo and set up your development environment.
2. Implement the backend and frontend as described.
3. Submit your forked repository with your code and documentation.

Good luck! ðŸš€
